# C# Syntax

## Previously you created your first C# program. Now we will learn how to write the code for C#.

### <span style = "font-size:25px; color:yellow">Curly Braces</span>

<span style = "font-size:20px">Curly Braces are how we seperate code blocks in C# if you have done any programming in Java, JavaScript, or C++ this will look very familiar to you. Another thing to note is that every line of code ends with ';' if this is not included you will get an error.</span>

<span style = "font-size:20px">Unlike Python, C# does not care about indentation. Whether something has been indented once or 100 times, you will not have an error appear like in Python.</span>

### <span style = "font-size:25px; color:yellow">The Main() Method.</span>

<span style = "font-size:20px">All C# programs must have a Main method. The main method is the entry point where the compiler will start reading code. Without a main method you will get an error.</span>

<span style = "font-size:15px; color:red">Note: C# is a case sensitive language. For instance the compiler will not recognize main() as the Main() method. The 'm' must be capitalized.</span>
