# C-Sharp Intro

![logo](../Assets/csharplogo.png)

<span style= "font-size:20px">C#(pronounced C-Sharp) is a programming language that runs on the .NET framework.</span>

<span style= "font-size:20px">It is an object oriented, type-safe programming language created by Microsoft and has roots in the C family. C# is very similar to other languages like C++ and Java. C# was created in 2002 and the current version C# 8 was created in September of 2019.</span>

## Why C-Sharp?

C# is used for many different things. Here are just a few:
* Web Services
* Desktop Applications
* Web Sites
* Games
* VR
* Database Applications

C# runs on the .NET framework, for more information on that check out, [what is .NET?](.NET-intro.md)

### <span style= "font-weight:700;color:yellow;font-size:25px">Compiled Language</span>
 <span style= "font-size:20px">C# is a compiled language, compiled languages are compiled by a compiler to an intermediate language. This executes faster than interpreted languages like Python which are read line by line as the program is executed. That is one of the benefits of C# and other compiled languages like it like C++ and Java. They are also really good at catching errors before the program actually runs! In C# when a program is compiled that is called a "build" this will compile and send out any errors or warnings about the code before it actually runs. This is annoying to most people but try and look at it as a helpful tool to warn you about errors in your code and to help you write better code.</span>

### <span style= "font-weight:700;color:yellow;font-size:25px">Casing in C#</span>
<span style= "font-size:20px">There are a few different ways to write code in C# in different casing. Here are definitions of each type and examples.</span>

<span style= "font-size:20px">Use pascal casing (PascalCasing) when naming a class, record or struct. </span>

<span style= "font-size:20px">When naming an interface use pascal casing with a prefix of an I before it (IPascalCasing)</span>

<span style= "font-size:20px">When naming public members of types such as fields, properties, events, methods, and local functions use pascal casing.</span>

<span style= "font-size:20px">When writing positional records, use pascal casing for parameters as theyre the public properties of the record.</span>

<span style= "font-size:20px">Use camel casing (camelCasing) when naming private or internal fields, and prefix them with _ (_camelCasing).</span>

![PascalCasing](../Assets/camelCasing.png)

<span style= "font-size:20px">When working with static fields that are private or internal, use the s_ (s_camelCasing) prefix and for thread static use t_ (t_camelCasing).</span>

<span style= "font-size:20px">When writing method parameters, use camel casing.</span>

<span style= "font-size:20px">Do not worry so much about Casing, it will not be looked at. This is just to help you get comfortable with the language and if you wish you continue to use c# later.</span>
