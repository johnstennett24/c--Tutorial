<span style = "font-size:20px">.NET is a free, open-source platform used for building different types of applications. .NET can be used with multiple languages but we will focus on C#. C# is a simple, modern, object-oriented and type-safe programming language.</span>

<span style = "font-size:20px">.NET provides a standard set of base class libraries and API's that are common to all .NET applications. Each app model can also expose additional APIs that are specific to the operating systems it runs on, of the capabilities it provides. For examples, ASP.ENT is the cross-platform web framework that provides additional APIs for building web apps that run on Linux of Windows.</span>
